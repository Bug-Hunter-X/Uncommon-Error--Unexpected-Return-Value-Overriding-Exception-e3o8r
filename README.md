This repository demonstrates an uncommon coding error in Python.  The `function_with_uncommon_error` function attempts to handle a division by zero, but due to an early return statement, it does not raise the expected `ZeroDivisionError`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and silent failures in an application. The solution provided demonstrates proper exception handling and clarifies the logical flow to prevent this issue.
